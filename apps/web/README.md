## Getting Started

First, install npm packages.
```bash
npm install
```

Second, add a `.env` file to this folder. Go to the Notion page to get the file contents, and copy it into this newly created file.

Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Lastly, run the backend server in ./backend_repo. (Only if you'll be making requests to the backend)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
